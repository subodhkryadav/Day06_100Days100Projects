## 🧠 Overview  
**Day 06** of my #100Days100Projects challenge — where code becomes modular and reusable!  
Today’s focus was on mastering **functions** in Python: defining, calling, and returning values — the building blocks of clean, reusable code.

With these concepts, I built an interactive **Basic Math Quiz Game** that tests the player’s skills with random addition, subtraction, and multiplication problems — all powered by custom functions.
